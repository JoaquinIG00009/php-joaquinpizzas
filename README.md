## How to make the project work:

	1. I used XAMPP, version 8.1.6-0 with MySQL Database and Apache Web Server.

	2. On localhost/phpmyadmin I created a new database called: 'pizza_db'.

	3. ThereÂ´s an exported database sql file in JoaquinPizzas/db_sql/pizza_db.sql

	4. On the file JoaquinPizzas/php/db.sql I configured the next details: 
		private $servername ='localhost';
	  	private $username='root';
	  	private $password='';
	  	private $dbname='pizza_db';

	5. The project folder must be in the /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/
